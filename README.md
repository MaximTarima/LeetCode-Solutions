# LeetCode Solutions
This is a repository where I was encouraged to begin documenting my LeetCode solutions. I began doing these problems for both entertaintment and educational purposes, so I attempt solve the problem on my own unless I absolutely cannot figure it out, in which case I'll at most try to ask for hints or potential approaches. As such, most of these problems are, while potentially imperfect, entirely my own effort. Also, my approach is to find a balanced solution that performs fairly well in terms of both runtime and memory, rather than maximizing either one.

## Folder Structure
Each problem is organized into its own folder, named after the problem's number. Inside each folder, you'll find solutions in different programming languages. Should be intuitive enough.

## Extra Data
For each solution, I document the following at the top:
- **Date:** The date when the solution was submitted and accepted.
- **Runtime:** The running time of the solution, including its percentile.
- **Memory:** The memory cost of the solution, including its percentile.
