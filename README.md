# LeetCode Solutions
This is a repository where I was encouraged to begin documenting my LeetCode solutions.

## Folder Structure
Each problem is organized into its own folder, named after the problem's number. Inside each folder, you'll find solutions in different programming languages.

## Extra Data
For each solution, I document the following:
- **Date:** The date when the solution was submitted and accepted.
- **Runtime:** The running time of the solution, including its percentile.
- **Memory:** The memory cost of the solution, including its percentile.
